IMD API example code
--------------------
  This is a simple example program that demonstrates how to write the
simulation engine side of an interactive molecular dynamics system using
the IMD interface in VMD.  In order to test it out, follow theses steps:
  1) Compile the code with the "make" command, edit the compile line 
     as needed. (some platforms don't need -lnsl or -lsocket...)

  2) Once compiled, run the newly compiled "testimd" program

  3) Start VMD, and load the "testimd.pdb" molecule, set the 
     graphical representation to "VDW" so you can see the simulated
     atom.

  4) While the "testimd" binary is running, and the "testimd.pdb" is loaded
     into VMD, type the following command into your VMD text console to 
     cause VMD to connect to the test simulation:
       imd connect localhost 54321

  5) Go ahead and play around.

  6) quit VMD, or type "imd detach" to disconnect from the test program.
